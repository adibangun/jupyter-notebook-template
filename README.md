# jupyter-notebook-template

This repository includes a Jupyter notebook and credentials file that serve as a template for Pivotal engagements with our customers. The Jupyter notebook imports certain relevant libraries and sets up default matplotlib parameters to make graphs more legible. The credentials file includes any login information to connect to a cluster such as HAWQ or GPDB.
